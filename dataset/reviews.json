I did a lot of research on finding the best home test kit and I know this one was on the pricier side but it was worth it. No other testing kits were as thorough and educational as this one. Not even a doctor takes the time to be this thorough! It was worth every dollar spent to get peace of mind about my health. Knowing about parasites, candida, and other gut health challenges is a major step in self-care.",

Thank you, Evan, for being available, communicative, friendly, and especially, so knowledgeable, about your work!",

        "review": "I found parasites.org after searching online for a parasite kit that tested for more than just Candida. I had done a holistic parasite cleanse prior to testing and decided after the cleanse that I needed to check for parasites since my symptoms didn't completely go away. I was wavering between thinking I had leaky gut or recurrent parasites, and I wanted more insight into what was actually in my gut. I wish now I would have tested first, then done the cleanse so I would have had a baseline to go off of.<br><br>Pros: The parasite kit arrived quickly after ordering it online and was easy to use. It came with clear instructions along with tips on how to get the best sample(s). Evan followed up, as promised, with a personal phone call to go over the test results and gave me some suggestions on what I could do to help my symptoms. Evan provided excellent customer service, I did not feel hurried on our phone call, and he offered a discount on further purchases.<br><br>Cons: I am accustomed to getting email updates on online purchases. I was disappointed that I did not get an email confirmation after the purchase, when my sample was received, or to notify that my sample was in the process of being assessed. I was nervous that the test kit was actually fake and that my sample was not received or being tested.<br>Overall, I was happy I invested in this test kit and would recommend it to anyone wanting a starting point for bothersome symptoms or periodically wanting to test/re-test. Evan has a passion for helping others understand parasites and his company is a great resource!",

As someone who does not like big corporations or even going to the Dr., I was shocked to experience easy, fast, thorough, friendly, and personalized service. Ordering the kit, providing a sample, and sending it back was very simple and discreet and was not complicating or time consuming like I had expected. Every question I emailed was quickly responded to and I received the results with a couple of days.<br><br>The results were explained in detail as well as personalized plan informing me of the best course of action to take that would help to remedy my situation. The plan was way more than I expected to get from a lab giving you test results because most places just tell you to go to the Dr and that's the extent of their advice. Parasites.org sets the bar on how a professional health service should conduct their business.",

        "review": "Thoughts on the experience: It was easy to do. I eliminated dark foods for one week to make it easier to identify the organisms as the directions suggested. Then I did four samples over four days during the full moon when parasites are said to reproduce and be more active. The directions and supplies were sufficient for the task. I had the results one week later! Evan thoroughly explained the findings and answered all my questions. And, because Evan provides this service I was able to share my results with my doctor and have a stool bacterial culture test ordered. I was also able to contact a doctor in my area with 40 years working with Immunology-Infectious Diseases and shared the results with him. I will hear from him next week once he has the results from the bacteria test. Thank you, Evan, for seeing a need and filling it! I greatly appreciate you, your knowledge and your commitment to helping people become healthy! Sincerely, Sue S.",
